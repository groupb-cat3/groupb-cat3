        <p>As she starts her first day of classes, she ends up loving it! Chadwick AI plays Taylor Swift during her classes for Mia to feel “in tune” with her emotions and help her connect with other girls. All of her friends are also in this course, so Mia fits in immediately. Most of the students taking the class are female, so she enjoys being surrounded by familiar faces and discussing behavioral and emotional complexities. The Chadwick AI algorithm is reinforced after this success. Everything seems to be going perfect for Mia. </p>
