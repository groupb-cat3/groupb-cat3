        <p>Chadwick AI: - plays EDM Strobe - “The Engineering Pathway class at your school is very academically rigorous, but you have always excelled in your math and science courses. The fast-paced EDM music will help you pick up the pace of your new learning. That would be an amazing opportunity for you to learn new things!”</p>

    <div class="container">
        <p>Mia signs up for the Engineering course, and Chadwick AI plays EDM music to facilitate the learning. The class is filled with guys Mia has never interacted with, which intimidates her at first and makes her shy away from making any friends. In addition, Mia is doubtful about the EDM music Chadwick continues to play because of her lack of exposure to the genre, making her really uncomfortable. Mia is barely keeping up with scores and assignments, but that motivates her to become a better student and explore new learning techniques. At the end of the semester, Mia is on top of her class and has discovered a new passion for engineering, as well as EDM music.
