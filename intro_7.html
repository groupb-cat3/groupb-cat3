        <p>You the reader are making the decision for that AI. The story is a representation of the way artificial intelligence could become a threat to younger generations that are easily influenced and shaped. If Mia grows without gender biases, she grows to be a confident woman who pursues what she loves without regard to societal expectations. However, if she becomes influenced by these gender biases, Miaâ€™s character development would be limited by gender biases, which categorize women as emotional and in motherly roles. Our overall claim is to showcase the threats of implementations of modern day artificial intelligence in education, which may endanger the way gender biases are perpetuated throughout younger generations that use AI as tools that shape their systems of beliefs.</p>
