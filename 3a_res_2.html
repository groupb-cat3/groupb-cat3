        <p>*** Studies show that background music can subtly influence a person’s mindset, goals, and identity. According to Saarikallio (2012), music often reinforces emotional states and behaviors. In Mia’s case, Chadwick AI’s use of soft lullaby melodies creates a calm, nurturing mood aligned with caregiving roles like nursing. While this seems supportive, it subtly narrows her sense of possibility by reinforcing gendered expectations of emotional softness. Instead of encouraging ambition or challenge, the AI promotes traits linked to femininity, steering Mia toward a less authoritative role. As Craiut and Iancu (2022) argue, AI often reflects societal biases by associating women with submissive traits, limiting their potential in male-dominated fields like medicine.***</p>
