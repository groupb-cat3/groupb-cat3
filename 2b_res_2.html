        <p>***AI algorithms, respectively, based on Mia's home and listening history, comfort level, and emotional bearings, recommend soft pop music and stories of helpers, nurturing women scientists who are described in language reinforcing certain gender norms. As the algorithm further reiterates her interest and emotional life, it also limits her ambition by keeping out leadership models, establishing her self-conception as a helper rather than a leader. Chadwick AI’s response comes from societal beliefs that restrict women within labor standards due to their gender characteristics (Garcia-Ull and Melero-Lazaro 2023). Although his response does not directly contain implications that demoralize Mia from pursuing her passions, the “soft pop” music reduces her solely to her emotional characteristics. This keeps her from breaking the social stigmas that denigrate women into emotional roles relating to selflessness and warmth, instead of encouraging towards positions of high prestige and power (Ahn el al. 2022).***</p>
