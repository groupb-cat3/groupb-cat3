       <p>Although this scientific research project contributed directly to Mia’s curiosity in STEM fields and her love for engineering and technology, it also discouraged the possibility of her success in research and derailed her from exploring other opportunities due to her gender. Mia then began to question the challenges she would face in a field dominated by men as a woman, disheartened by a lack of representation and doubted the likelihood of her success.</p>

       <p>***Research by García-Ull and Melero-Lázaro (2023) emphasizes that gendered narratives and visual stereotypes in AI and educational media directly affect how young women perceive their place in professional spaces. When AI downplays the achievements of underrepresented figures like Rosalind Franklin or frames women’s roles through a limited emotional or caregiving lens, it subtly discourages ambitious pathways. Chadwick’s suggestion of nursing and the omission of Franklin’s recognition reflect this dynamic. Though Mia’s assignment fuels her interest in science, the biased portrayal of scientific history, coupled with music that evokes soft, emotional introspection like “Cornfield Chase”, creates a learning environment that subconsciously reinforces the belief that high-level scientific achievement may be out of reach for someone like her.</p>
