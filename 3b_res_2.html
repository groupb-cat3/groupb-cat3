       <p>Because of your responses, Mia fell into the traditional roles her family had kept in their family for decades. Instead of growing and finding equitable opportunities for herself regardless of her gender, she found conformity in knowing that she would probably be a good mother, as women are supposed to be.</p>

       <p>***As Susan Leavy (2018) explains, AI systems often reinforce gender stereotypes when built without attention to diversity or gender theory. Algorithms trained on biased historical data tend to associate women with caregiving and domestic roles, which is reflected in modern outputs. By recommending a song like “The Mother” and nudging Mia toward motherhood as a career path, Chadwick AI is not being neutral, it’s echoing long-standing gender norms. This limits Mia’s ability to freely define her goals, showing how uncritical AI design can restrict young women’s aspirations. As Ahn et al. (2022) argue, AI mirrors societal biases from its training data, and in this case, it promotes a stereotypical, gendered role for Mia rather than considering her potential.***</p>
