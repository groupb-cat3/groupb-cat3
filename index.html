        <strong>Proposition:</strong><br>
        In the Midwestern United States, women have equitable access to abortion care.

        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <iframe src="assets/residence_viz.html" width="900" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
          <figcaption>Abortion rates remain relatively consistent across the Midwest, suggesting steady, equitable availability of care regardless of location.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Design Decisions and Rationale:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Color Scale Compression (-1):</strong><br>  
            A compressed sequential blues scale (from #ffffff to #2171b5) was used to minimize visual contrast and suggest stability across states. This subtly shapes perception, as viewers interpret small differences as negligible even when variation exists. While the data remain accurate, the color similarity downplays disparities. We considered binning or bucketing values, but that felt too overt. This approach preserves data integrity while achieving a gentler, more persuasive visual effect.
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <strong>Narrow Data Range (+1):</strong><br>
            We capped the color scale at 17.1, the maximum rate in Illinois, which is a standard, earnest approach since scales often end at the data maximum. However, by pairing this with a relatively lighter dark-blue endpoint, we subtly enhanced the perception of uniformity across states. We considered using a consistent max of 25 for both graphs to maintain comparability, but since the maps are viewed in isolation, using a lighter maximum color reinforced our narrative of steady, equitable access while staying data-accurate.
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <strong>Equity-Affirmative Title/Subtitle (+1):</strong><br>
            We used a direct, affirmative title (“Midwest Residents Enjoy Equitable Abortion Access”), paired with a subtle subtitle that emphasizes the fairly consistent distribution of care. This choice is earnest, as it accurately describes the data, but it also reinforces the narrative by framing the map as a story of equity before viewers even analyze the visual. Alternative, more neutral options (e.g., “Abortion Rates by State Residence”) would have been factually correct but less persuasive. The selected phrasing works well because it draws attention to the uniformity of rates across residences without misrepresenting any numbers or data used.
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <strong>Subtle Reinforcement in Text Annotation/Caption (-1.5):</strong><br>
            We added a descriptive annotation (“Most Midwest states report 6–10 abortions per 1,000 women”) directly under the map. While the numbers are accurate, the phrasing selectively emphasizes uniformity and downplays any variation between states, subtly implying that you have access to abortion as a Midwest resident. We considered pointing out a state, but we chose this wording to reinforce the narrative of equity across all states, making the visualization persuasive while staying technically correct.

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <iframe src="assets/occurrence_viz.html" width="900" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
          <figcaption>Abortion access is concentrated in Illinois and a few neighbors, leaving much of the Midwest underserved.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Design Decisions and Rationale:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Expanded Color Scale (-1):</strong><br>
            We used a sequential blues scale with pronounced gradations (#ffffff to #08519c) to maximize contrast between neighboring states and highlight imbalances in abortion access. This exaggerates visual differences without manipulating the underlying data. We considered binning or bucketing values to leverage the skew effect, but this approach preserves data integrity while subtly pushing the narrative that abortion access is concentrated in a few hotspots.
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <strong>Geographical Focus (0):</strong><br>
            Choosing to restrict this visualization to Midwestern states is not inherently earnest or deceptive. During exploratory data analysis, we observed that differences in abortion access are most pronounced in the Midwest, so focusing here best highlights regional imbalances. We considered showing the entire U.S. map but ultimately focused on the Midwest to reinforce this side of the proposition.
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <strong>Leading Title/Subtitle Combination (-1.5):</strong><br>
            The title (“Few Midwest States Offer Broad Abortion Access”) directly highlights the uneven distribution of abortion care, which is further strengthened by the subtitle’s mention of care gaps. This is persuasive because it frames the map as a story of scarcity before viewers even analyze the data. While factually accurate, the wording emphasizes the extremes and scarcity rather than providing a neutral description (e.g., “Abortion Rates by State of Occurrence”). We considered alternative phrasing, but we chose the current wording to emphasize the imbalance across states.
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <strong>Comparative Text Annotation/Caption (+1.5):</strong><br>
            The caption (“Illinois performs 200× more procedures than neighboring Missouri”) underscores the dramatic concentration of services in a single state by comparing it to its immediate neighbor. This draws attention to disparities and reinforces the narrative of limited access. Since no data have been manipulated, this is technically accurate and selectively highlights extreme differences rather than reporting the full range of state values. A more neutral caption like “Procedure rates vary across states” was considered but would have reduced the persuasive impact of comparing the two extreme states.

        <h2><strong>Final Reflection:</strong></h2>

        <p>In the visualization creation process, the difficulty of this project came from the goal of finding a creative data transformation and visualization that would be able to convey positions from both sides of the spectrum. We were especially surprised by how many different conclusions could be drawn from the dataset we used (Abortion Data), and how it could be used to push agendas for or against certain policies, depending on how it was presented. As such, the way we framed our data greatly controlled our narrative, as it directly affected the interpretation, readability, and design choices. </p>
        <p>We define ethical analysis and visualization as the process of using data and creating visualizations that resemble a trend occurring in reality. We consider data to be misleading if the numbers are grossly exaggerated, misrepresented, or if viewers are intentionally deceived.
        However, if the data is transformed reasonably, remains accurate, and is presented in a clear, understandable way that helps viewers reach a well-informed conclusion, we consider it acceptable and ethical. A misleading example would be if the sales of three items differ by only 1%, but the graph is zoomed in to exaggerate this small difference, making it appear much larger than it is. An ethical visualization, by contrast, would accurately show the differences in revenue from the three items, allowing for a fair comparison.
        </p>
        <p>We concluded that the boundary between acceptable persuasive choices and misleading ones lies in the accuracy of the information. Deliberately presenting false data is clearly unethical. Using accurate data to highlight a particular perspective can still be ethical, as long as the data truthfully supports the position being presented. Ultimately, it is up to the viewer to critically interpret and question the choices made in framing the data, and draw their own conclusions.</p>
