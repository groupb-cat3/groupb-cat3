        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <iframe src="assets/residence_viz.html" width="900" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
          <figcaption>Abortion rates remain relatively consistent across the Midwest, suggesting steady, equitable availability of care regardless of location.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Design Decisions and Rationale:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Color Scale Compression (-1):</strong><br>  
            A compressed sequential blues scale (from #ffffff to #2171b5) was used to minimize visual contrast and suggest stability across states. This subtly shapes perception, as viewers interpret small differences as negligible even when variation exists. While the data remain accurate, the color similarity downplays disparities. We considered binning or bucketing values, but that felt too overt. This approach preserves data integrity while achieving a gentler, more persuasive visual effect.
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <strong>Narrow Data Range (+1):</strong><br>
            We capped the color scale at 17.1, the maximum rate in Illinois, which is a standard, earnest approach since scales often end at the data maximum. However, by pairing this with a relatively lighter dark-blue endpoint, we subtly enhanced the perception of uniformity across states. We considered using a consistent max of 25 for both graphs to maintain comparability, but since the maps are viewed in isolation, using a lighter maximum color reinforced our narrative of steady, equitable access while staying data-accurate.
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <strong>Subtle Reinforcement in Title/Subtitle (+1):</strong><br>
            We used a direct, affirmative title (“Midwest Residents Enjoy Equitable Abortion Access”), paired with a subtle subtitle that emphasizes the fairly consistent distribution of care. This choice is earnest, as it accurately describes the data, but it also reinforces the narrative by framing the map as a story of equity before viewers even analyze the visual. Alternative, more neutral options (e.g., “Abortion Rates by State Residence”) would have been factually correct but less persuasive. The selected phrasing works well because it draws attention to the uniformity of rates without misrepresenting any numbers, giving the visualization rhetorical power while staying ethically grounded.
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <strong>Text Annotation/Caption (-2):</strong><br>
            We added a descriptive annotation (“Most Midwest states report 6–10 abortions per 1,000 women, indicating broadly similar access”) directly under the map. While the numbers are accurate, the phrasing selectively emphasizes uniformity and downplays any variation between states, subtly guiding the viewer toward the intended conclusion. Alternative options could have simply displayed raw numbers or omitted the annotation, but we chose this wording to reinforce the narrative of equity, making the visualization more persuasive while staying technically true.

          <figcaption>Abortion access in the Midwest is far from uniform. Illinois and a few surrounding states serve as hubs for procedures, leaving large portions of the region underserved.</figcaption>
