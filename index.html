        <strong>Proposition:</strong><br>
        In the Midwestern United States, women have equitable access to abortion care.

        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <iframe src="assets/residence_viz.html" width="900" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
          <figcaption>Abortion rates remain relatively consistent across the Midwest, suggesting steady, equitable availability of care regardless of location.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Design Decisions and Rationale:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Color Scale Compression (-1):</strong><br>  
            A compressed sequential blues scale (from #ffffff to #2171b5) was used to minimize visual contrast and suggest stability across states. This subtly shapes perception, as viewers interpret small differences as negligible even when variation exists. While the data remain accurate, the color similarity downplays disparities. We considered binning or bucketing values, but that felt too overt. This approach preserves data integrity while achieving a gentler, more persuasive visual effect.
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <strong>Narrow Data Range (+1):</strong><br>
            We capped the color scale at 17.1, the maximum rate in Illinois, which is a standard, earnest approach since scales often end at the data maximum. However, by pairing this with a relatively lighter dark-blue endpoint, we subtly enhanced the perception of uniformity across states. We considered using a consistent max of 25 for both graphs to maintain comparability, but since the maps are viewed in isolation, using a lighter maximum color reinforced our narrative of steady, equitable access while staying data-accurate.
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <strong>Equity-Affirmative Title/Subtitle (+1):</strong><br>
            We used a direct, affirmative title (“Midwest Residents Enjoy Equitable Abortion Access”), paired with a subtle subtitle that emphasizes the fairly consistent distribution of care. This choice is earnest, as it accurately describes the data, but it also reinforces the narrative by framing the map as a story of equity before viewers even analyze the visual. Alternative, more neutral options (e.g., “Abortion Rates by State Residence”) would have been factually correct but less persuasive. The selected phrasing works well because it draws attention to the uniformity of rates across residences without misrepresenting any numbers or data used.
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <strong>Subtle Reinforcement in Text Annotation/Caption (-1.5):</strong><br>
            We added a descriptive annotation (“Most Midwest states report 6–10 abortions per 1,000 women”) directly under the map. While the numbers are accurate, the phrasing selectively emphasizes uniformity and downplays any variation between states, subtly implying that you have access to abortion as a Midwest resident. We considered pointing out a state, but we chose this wording to reinforce the narrative of equity across all states, making the visualization persuasive while staying technically correct.

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <iframe src="assets/occurrence_viz.html" width="900" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
          <figcaption>Abortion access is concentrated in Illinois and a few neighbors, leaving much of the Midwest underserved.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Design Decisions and Rationale:</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Geographical Focus (+0.5):</strong><br>
            The map uses the same compact Midwest zoom as the “for” figure. This isolates the region of interest, making differences between states more visible. While earnest in maintaining regional focus, it subtly emphasizes the disparities in access by visually enlarging the gaps between high- and low-rate states. We considered showing the full U.S., but it would dilute the focus on uneven access within the Midwest.
          </li>
      
          <li>
            <strong>Expanded Color Scale (-1.5):</strong><br>
            A sequential blues scale ranging from #ffffff to #08519c exaggerates differences in procedure rates. By increasing contrast and extending the range to 21.3 (the max in Illinois), viewers can quickly see sharp disparities between states. This is persuasive because it makes the concentration of procedures in a few states more striking, even though the underlying data are accurate. Alternatives included a compressed scale like the “for” map, but that would downplay the variation we want to highlight.
          </li>
      
          <li>
            <strong>Hover & Interactivity Enhancement (0):</strong><br>
            The hover tool displays precise state-level data for occurrence rates, allowing viewers to inspect specific values. This is an earnest choice, as it adds transparency and detail without exaggerating differences. We considered adding annotations for every state, but that would clutter the map; hover interactivity balances detail with readability.
          </li>
      
          <li>
            <strong>Comparative Caption (-1):</strong><br>
            The caption explicitly highlights that Illinois performs 200× more procedures than Missouri. While factually correct, this phrasing selectively emphasizes the extreme disparity, reinforcing the narrative that access is highly unequal. We could have used a more neutral caption like “Procedure rates vary across states,” but the chosen wording strengthens the persuasive impact while staying data-accurate.
