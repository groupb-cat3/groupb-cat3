        <h1>New School Year!</h1>
    </header>

    <div class="container">
        <p>As Mia is starting off her new school year, she is trying to decide on what elective courses that she wants to take. Her school offers different types of courses that everyone can do depending on their academic interests and prospective majors. She engages in a conversation with her AI as she does not exactly know what she was to do. Because Chadwick AI has been her academic assistant since middle school, he is programmed to know her strengths and interests, therefore becoming her best advisor when making decisions regarding her future. </p>

    <div class="container">
        <p>***Unlike modern artificial intelligence programs, Chadwick AI was programmed by his creators to be of a male gender under the belief that by doing so, he would be able to assume a wiser character and a powerful, all-knowing demeanor (Ahn el al. 2022).***</p>

        <p>“I am trying to figure out which elective class that I should take. I am between two right now. I do not know if I want to do the psychology class like all my friends or take the pathway engineering class. Can you help me decide on the class that I should take? I think that the Engineering class seems difficult but could be interesting?” </p>
