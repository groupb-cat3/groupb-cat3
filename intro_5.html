        <p>The danger of relying on artificial intelligence for education falls on the presence of biased responses that destroy progress made towards the equity and inclusivity of women in male dominated fields. Due to the stereotypes present in datasets that are utilized to train machine learning algorithms, Chadwick AI is inherently biased due to the stereotypes it learns from and the engineers who design said algorithms (Leavy 2018). As society consumes artificial intelligence responses that are shaped with the relation of women with ideals of motherhood and fragility, and men with connotations of power and wisdom (Garcia-Ull and Melero-Lazaro 2023 and Craiut, M.-V., and I. R. Iancu 2022), it leaves its users susceptible to the swaying of individual thinking and the reinforcement of gender biases.</p>
