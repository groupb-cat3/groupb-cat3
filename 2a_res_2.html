        <p>***AI analyzes Mia’s reading pace, content engagement, and emotional response data to curate personalized stories of underrecognized scientists from diverse backgrounds, paired with instrumental music by women composers shown to improve focus and motivation. By aligning her psychological needs and learning patterns with empowering content, the algorithm helps Mia connect deeply with science, igniting a new sense of belonging and possibility in the field. Chadwick AI’s response is not deeply rooted in gendering ideals contained in machine learning databases. However, utilizing Taylor Swift is still an expected response that categorizes Mia within the traditional roles of tending to enjoy emotional and romantic ballads (Craiut, M.-V., and I. R. Iancu 2022). Nevertheless, the empowering lyrics motivate her to feel comfortable exploring interests she had not thought about and take academic risks.***</p>
