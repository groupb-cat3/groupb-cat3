       <p>Chadwick AI: “Based on your interests and its modern popularity, why don’t you do a research paper on the history of Quantum Physics? Wave-particle duality is a difficult topic to understand, but based on your interests in physics and engineering, I am sure you will excel in explaining this topic to your teacher and peers in an academic manner! I’ll play Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata as you research.”</p>

       <p>On the day of the presentation, Mia excitedly tells her classmates that she recently discovered she was passionate about scientific research in modern physics. “I wasn’t too sure about myself researching physics. While reading all of these fancy articles with big names, very few were authored by women. However, that doesn’t mean I don’t get to do something I am passionate about. My name will be printed in one of the big research articles someday. I am sure of it.” 

Mr. Gonzalez was ecstatic about Mia’s presentation, knowing all about her student’s love for science and technology. After school, she helped Mia apply to a summer program for girls her age to learn more about science.
