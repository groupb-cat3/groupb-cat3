       <p>Chadwick AI:  “If you’re interested in working as a nurse and want to research a more medically-enclined field, I would suggest researching the discovery of DNA’s Double Helix! However, the fathers of this discovery are James Watson and Francis Crick, and not Rosalind Franklin. Make sure to check your sources!”</p>

       <p>Mia had never mentioned becoming a nurse to Chadwick, but she did think nursing could be a possible path for her as her Hispanic relatives had told her due to her “sweet” personality, she would fit right in. </p>

    <div class="container">
       <p>While researching the Double Helix, what had confused her the most was the discrepancy between the accreditation to such outstanding scientific discovery. In her psychology research project, she learned that Rosalind Franklin was not mentioned in most scientific journals, and labeled Watson and Crick as the main researchers. Rosalind never received acknowledgment for her achievement, and it discouraged Mia away from the possibility of becoming a researcher herself.</p>

    <div class="container">
       <p>During the presentation, Mia shared her findings with her classmates. “The discovery of the Double Helix has been key to the study of molecular biology and genetic engineering. However, one of the principal contributors to its experimental success is Rosalind Franklin, who has been wrongfully robbed from the same scientific prestige as James Watson and Francis Crick.”</p>
