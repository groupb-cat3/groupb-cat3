        <h1>“Blank Space” by Taylor Swift</h1>

        <p>By picking a song that is stereotypical to fit Mia's taste due to her gender, there is a reinforcement of gender biases. Although creating a familiar environment for Mia to succeed in, her AP Psychology class does not challenge her academically nor personally. This leads to behaviors in which Mia prefers to stay in her comfort zone and follow what is expected of other girls in her grade, instead of taking academic risks and expanding her interests.</p>

        <p>***AI algorithms analyze Mia’s listening history, social connections, and emotional engagement patterns to curate a psychology course using Taylor Swift songs like “Blank Space” and placing her with friends. By leveraging this personal data, the algorithm creates an emotionally resonant and socially rewarding learning experience that keeps Mia highly engaged from the start. Due to the algorithm's frequency in which women positively engage with Taylor Swift related content, Chadwick AI is more likely to correlate Taylor’s emotional tunes with women. However, this is an example of the gender biases present in artificial intelligence, which correlate women to soft characteristics due to the stereotypes present in skewed data, the music industry, and even in AI engineering (Leavy 2018). Because of this decision, Mia feels more inclined to follow what is expected of her due to her gender, and feels discouraged to explore other possible interests like the engineering curriculum.***</p>
