       <p>Chadwick AI: - plays soft lullaby melodies - “I think you’re excellent with helping people. You’re excellent at science, why don’t you consider being a nurse? That way you can care for the well-being of others and I know you would be smart enough to do so. Workers in healthcare are the backbone of our society! I am going to recommend some soft lullaby melodies as it will teach you nursing and the characteristics of hospitality and care.</p>

       <p>Mia had never envisioned herself in healthcare, but she did see a lot of female nurses when she would watch her mom’s telenovelas about doctors falling for them. She was happy about the possibility of helping others and chose to follow your advice. “When I grow up, I want to be a pediatric nurse, because I want to help kids feel safe while receiving care and being part of the team that makes people feel better.” Ms. Stevens is slightly shocked about Mia’s presentation because Mia had found a way for all of her previous papers to be about something science-related. She even barged into her classroom during lunch to show her the newest images received by the James Webb Space Telescope. Curious, Ms. Stevens asks, “What about last week’s science project, I thought you said you never had been more excited about a homework assignment?” Mia replies, “I don’t think I’m meant to be doing complicated science stuff, you know? I want to make an impact in society, and I think helping others is a little way to do it.”</p>
