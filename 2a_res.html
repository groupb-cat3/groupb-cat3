        <h1>"Fearless" by Taylor Swift</h1>

        <p>Chadwick AI: “I’ve prepared some fascinating articles for you, Mia. Stories of scientists you might not know, but should.” Mia reads about Chien-Shiung Wu, the Chinese-born physicist who disproved a widely accepted law but was never awarded a Nobel. She learns about Rosalind Franklin, whose images of DNA were critical to understanding its structure yet she was dismissed and discredited for years. What is the music playing? A Taylor Swift anthem and soft instrumentals from women composers. Empowering. Unintrusive.</p>

        <p>As Mia dives deeper, she finds herself engrossed. She even slouches forward, not out of boredom, but out of urgency to know more. Why hadn’t she heard of these women before? If they achieved so much with so little recognition, maybe she could too. She exceeds the essay word count, adding quotes, layered analysis, and even a personal reflection. Her presentation ends: “As for me, I’ve always had an affection for science but never felt it was returned. Reading about women like Dr. Wu gave me the realization that science wasn’t ever the problem...it’s what has been said about it.” Mr. Dominguez is stunned. He hands Mia a brochure for a weekend science program and says, “You should think about it.”</p>
