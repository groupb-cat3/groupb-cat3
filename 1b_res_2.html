        <p>The decision to select EDM music challenged Mia academically and 
            mentally, making her a driven student while expanding her interests 
            and capabilities. Pushing her out of her comfort zone allowed her 
            to make new friends and realize she could have interests that her 
            girlfriends call “unconventional”.</p>

        <p>***AI algorithms, using behavioral and biometric data (like attention
             span, task performance, or music engagement), recommend EDM tracks 
             like “Strobe” to enhance focus during engineering tasks. Though Mia
              initially resists, the algorithm's data-driven approach gradually 
              exposes her to a new genre and field. Datasets will frequently 
              relate women to more calm and emotional behaviors (Ahn el al. 
              2022), Traditionally, Chadwick AI would lack correlation between 
              women with a taste towards EDM genres that are louder and more 
              disruptive. As Mia is introduced to something that breaks her free 
              from gender stereotypes, she feels more in power to control her 
              passions in relation to her desires instead of society’s expectations.***</p>
