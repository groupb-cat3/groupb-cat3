        <p>Chadwick AI: “Let's explore stories of women in caregiving science roles. That may suit your strengths in emotional intelligence and compassion.”</p>

        <p>This time, Mia reads about Florence Nightingale, Clara Barton, and a quiet lab worker who helped develop vaccines but wasn’t credited on the patent. The articles describe them as “compassionate,” “supportive,” and “selfless.” The background music? Soft pop love songs—songs her mom plays while folding laundry. Although Gracie Abrams is also a prominent woman in pop, her songs are related more to a sensitive, emotional female audience.</p>

        <p>The stories comfort Mia. They feel familiar. She writes a strong, organized paper and concludes: “Women have contributed enormously to developmental research studies. I want to help others as well.” Confused, Mr. Dominguez asks her if she came across any inventors or scientists in leadership roles, Mia pauses. “I didn’t find them. I guess helping is just more my thing.”</p>
