        <p>Mia, a high school student, relies on Chadwick AI in a developmental storyline in which she is faced with decisions that set her up for personal and academic success. Navigating her last years before college, she must discover her academic passions, but also learn about her personal morality and value as an individual. Although seemingly a positive tool in the educational development of young minds, the artificial intelligence companion poses a disadvantage: The responses that she gives Mia are unreliable, skewed by incorrect and opinionated responses. Modern datasets, the information that Chadwick AI learns from, are still unable to be filtered to restrict gendered biased ideals, with machine learning engineers continuing to perpetuate harmful stereotypes due to personal biases. These engineers ultimately control what society learns from artificial intelligence machines, creating a positive feedback loop in which gender stereotypes are perpetuated and reinforced.</p>

        <p>Although AI systems appear intelligent and impartial, they are far from perfect. The algorithms behind them are influenced by the biases of the data they are trained on and the people who design them. This means that even when AI seems helpful, offering suggestions, guiding choices, or recommending learning paths, it may unknowingly reinforce stereotypes or exclude possibilities. In education, this can subtly yet powerfully shape a studentâ€™s identity, influencing not only what they learn, but also who they believe they can become. </p>
