       <p>After several months of settling into high school, Mia is beginning to feel a little more confident. Her grades have started to improve, and she’s grown comfortable with how her AI assistant has helped her stay focused and organized. Still, she sometimes wonders if she’s really good at the subjects she’s doing better in, or if the AI just knows what to feed her to keep her going. She asks Chadwick AI for a recommendation, considering if she should switch out into an easier class, or if she should’ve taken AP Psychology in the first place. </p>
