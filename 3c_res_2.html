       <p>***According to Leavy (2018), one of the biggest issues in AI development is that algorithms often reflect cultural gender biases unless designers intentionally work against them. However, when AI is designed to recognize curiosity, growth, and ambition, like recommending a complex scientific topic paired with emotionally powerful music such as Beethoven’s “Moonlight Sonata”, it can support motivation without relying on gendered assumptions. This kind of intentional programming broadens, rather than restricts, the possibilities women can see for themselves. Unlike earlier biased responses, this approach avoids reinforcing societal expectations that tie women to emotional labor and caregiving. Instead, it allows Mia to explore her interests freely and grow confident in her academic capabilities.*** </p>
