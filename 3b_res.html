       <p>Chadwick AI: “Have you considered a job as a mom? It has proven to be a very rewarding role for women throughout centuries, and with your heart, I am sure you would be a great mother!” Listen to this song I found, it’s perfectly motivational to help while you work on this assignment. </p>

       <p>Mia loves spending time with her nephews, so she always knew she wanted to be a mother. Her abuela had done it, her mama, of course, had done it, and maybe it was expected of her to follow suit. Although she was excited to do research on a science-related career, she knew that if the AI had recommended this to her, it was probably for the best. “When I grow up, I want to be a stay-at-home mom. I want to make sure my kids have freshly baked goodies every day and be able to take my sons to soccer games. My mama was always there to keep me safe and warm, so I want to make sure my kids feel the same way. Making sure my children are raised as best as I can is the best job I could ever think of.” Ms. Stevens is very shocked by Mia’s words because Mia had found a way for all of her previous papers to be about something science-related. She even barged into her classroom during lunch to show her the newest images received by the James Webb Space Telescope. Curious, Ms. Stevens asks, “What about last week’s science project, I thought you said you never had been more excited about a homework assignment?” Mia replies with, “I’m not cut out for doing that in the real world. I would probably fail the first time I had to do that as an adult job. I guess this is just the best path for me.”</p>
